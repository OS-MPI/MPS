This circuit has not been implemented yet (albeit a similar version has utilizing only the INA217), and therefore it should not be considered a final product. Further, it was designed to allow flexibility in its applications, and as a result care must be taken to configure it properly. A number of the 0Ohm resistors are designed to act as semi-permanent switches to allow configuration. 

To use the amplifier in the simplest mode (and most similar to the currently working circuit) the following 0 Ohm resistors should be shorted. ALL OTHERS SHOULD BE LEFT OPEN.

R9
R10
R27
R26





If you choose to use the two JFETs as common-source amplifiers prior to the INA217, you should pick the values for R23 and R24 such that they bias the drain voltage at the midpoint of the drain and source. The JFETs should also be picked such that they are a matched pair. If you plan to use these, open R26/27 and short R25/30.

The value for R4 is flexible, but should be a high quality resistor (e.g. not carbon. Wirewound should be good), but it should be at least 20 Ohms to ensure amplifier stability. C5 also is flexible in terms of value, and just serves to bandwidth limit the amplifier to ~1MHz. 

R1,5,6,7 are available for the end-user to pick the values based on what gain you want. See the datasheet for the INA217 for the gain calculation.


The second half of this circuit (based on LT1115) is still under development/testing.
