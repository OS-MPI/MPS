## Motivation and Introduction

The system we are calling the MPS device is a low cost, simple to manufacture project which more generally speaking is a platform designed around elucidating particle characteristics for superparamagentic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The motivation was to condense the numerous existing systems into a singlular platform capable of providing insights into the nanoparticles irrespective of the specific goal of the lab. With that in mind, calling our platform an "MPS" system is rather imprecise; while one mode is traditional "spectroscopy" the device is designed to be flexible and able to perform relaxometry measurements as well as magnetometry, yet in order to give the project an easy-to-find, descriptive name, we settled on the "magnetic particle spectroscopy" system. 

## State of the project

As with all other systems hosted on this GitHub page, the MPS system is still being actively developed. In the current state (of Aug, 2020) we have the system working in all [three primary operational modes](https://github.com/OS-MPI/MPS/wiki/Modes-of-operation). The hardware is being continually improved, recently focusing on the system amplifiers. The drive amplifier is now based around the OPA549, which has proved more robust than the previous designs, and should be able to be parallelized for increased power.


The main upcoming goals will be to refine the software. Namely, improving the flexibility and efficiency of the code, in addition to that, we are standardizing a data format with accompanying documentation such that other groups will be able to read files produced by our (or similar) systems. That brings up the next major room for improvement, which is the documentation. Going forward we plan to continually add to the documentation such as adding operational and construction instructions.
