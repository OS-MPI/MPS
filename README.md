# The Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS) device

## Motivation and Introduction

The system we are calling the MPS device is a low cost, simple to manufacture project which more generally speaking is a platform designed around elucidating particle characteristics for superparamagentic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs). The motivation was to condense the numerous existing systems into a singlular platform capable of providing insights into the nanoparticles irrespective of the specific goal of the lab. With that in mind, calling our platform an "MPS" system is rather imprecise; while one mode is traditional "spectroscopy" the device is designed to be flexible and able to perform relaxometry measurements as well as magnetometry, yet in order to give the project an easy-to-find, descriptive name, we settled on the "magnetic particle spectroscopy" system. 

## State of the project

As with all other systems hosted on this GitHub page, the MPS system is still being actively developed. In the current state (of Dec. 1, 2019) we have the system working in "magnetometry mode", though we are currently using larger commercial drive amplifiers and low noise amplifiers. Both the Apex PA12A and INA217 are working well and independently, yet have not been integrated into the system. The bulk of the hardware has been developed and implemented and should be sufficient for all three major modes of operation. Regarding software, the system currently operates through a MATLAB script and runs the excitation sequence requisite for magnetometry with future work expanding the capabilities.
