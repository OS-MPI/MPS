## Motivation and Introduction

The system we are calling the MPS device is a low cost, and fairly simple to manufacture project which more generally speaking is a platform designed around understanding magnetic characteristics of superparamagentic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs).


## State of the project

The MPS system is still being actively developed. In the current state (of Nov, 2022) well with high sensitivity. The recent progress has been toward improving the hardware and user interface.

## Example results

The sensitivity of the system illustrated by plotting the signal amplitude from various masses of Synomag-D 70nm against the mass of each sample. The volume of each sample was 4 microliters and acquisition time was under one second for each.

## Future work

The main goal is to upgrade the documentation. Namely, adding the full software, protocols for operation, and data format guidelines.
